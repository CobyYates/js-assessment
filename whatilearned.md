# What I learned

### I learned that this is a great way to test my knowledge of js
### This practice helped me to really get better at problem solving
### Some examples of things I have never done, but have learned are:
* Join two arrays together
* Determin a location of an item in an array
* Remove all instances of a value in an array
* Count the occurances of an item in an array

# How many tests was I able to pass
### With the time I had with travelling and family, I was able to get 10 done in arrays. More to come though

# Challenges/roadblocks
### I struggled understanding how to remove all instances of a value from an array, returning the original array
### Finding duplicates in an array
### Some es6 syntax I found worked, but I don't quite understand the syntax yet. For example...
```js
let count = arr.reduce((n, x) => n + (x === item), 0)
```
